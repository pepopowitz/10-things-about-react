Trail: 2. JSX

> JSX is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript without any defined semantics.

[facebook.github.io/jsx/](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/)

Notes:

It's XML in Javascript

---

Trail: 2. JSX

```
function Artist() {
  return React.createElement('div');
}
```

```
function Artist() {
  return <div />;
}
```

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

Here's our first example from before - React.createElement to render a div.

...

Here's what it looks like as JSX

(PAUSE)

note - no quotes around angle brackets

---

Trail: 2. JSX

```
function Artist(props) {
  return React.createElement(
    'div',
    { id: 'artist-wrapper' },
    props.name
  );
}
```

```
function Artist(props) {
  return (
    <div id="artist-wrapper">
      {props.name}
    </div>
  )
}
```

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

- example that renders a name

(PAUSE)

- you might think you'll hate it
  - combo of xml & javascript, yikes!
  - but react.createElement is verbose & gross

---

Trail: 2. JSX

```
function Artist(props) {
  return React.createElement(
    'div',
    { id: 'artist' },
    React.createElement(
      'div',
      { id: 'bio' },
      React.createElement('h1', null, props.name),
      React.createElement('h2', null, props.origin + ', ' + props.lifespan)
    ),
    React.createElement(
      'div',
      { id: 'photo' },
      React.createElement(
        'a',
        {
          href: '/artists/' + props.id,
        },
        React.createElement('img', {
          src: props.profileImageUrl,
          alt: props.name,
        })
      )
    )
  )
}
```

Notes:

remember this more complicated component?

With JSX, it looks like this:

---

Trail: 2. JSX

```
function Artist(props) {
  return (
    <div id="artist">
      <div id="bio">
        <h1>{props.name}</h1>
        <h2>{props.origin}, {props.lifespan}</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="photo">
        <a href={'/artists/' + props.id}>
          <img src={props.profileImageUrl} alt={props.name} />
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Notes:

(PAUSE)

It looks like the markup we want it to emit!

Trail: 2. JSX

## Separation Of Concerns

Notes:

Often when people see JSX, they start talking about "separation of concerns"

---

Trail: 2. JSX, Separation Of Concerns

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/slicing-horizontal.jpg" data-background-size="75%" data-background-color="#ffffff" -->

Notes:

And our instinct as engineers, historically, is to separate our code into layers

keep your HTML with your HTML, JS with JS, ...

---

Trail: 2. JSX, Separation Of Concerns

> Instead of artificially **separating technologies** by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both.

[reactjs.org](reactjs.org)

Notes:

React addresses this claim head-on

Stating that this traditional separation is a separation of _technologies_, not concerns

(read it)

---

Trail: 2. JSX, Separation Of Concerns

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/slicing-vertical.jpg" data-background-size="75%" data-background-color="#ffffff" -->

Notes:

When you're thinking in components, you can scrap the technological layers

The concern is each individual component

(PAUSE)

---

Trail: 2. JSX

```
function Artist(props) {
  if (props.name === 'Andy Warhol') {
    return <div>I like your soup cans!</div>;
  }
  return <div>You make nice art.</div>;
}
```

Notes:

Because JSX is a superset of JavaScript,

we can write our components entirely in JS

No templating languages necessary.

Here's a component that's using an if to decide which div to render.

We get to use latest ES features anywhere in our code.

---

Trail: 2. JSX

## Components in JSX lead to **declarative** code

Notes:

Let's talk a bit about why that matters,

and we'll start with what it means for code to be declarative.

---

Trail: 2. JSX, Declarative

**Q:** How do you get to my house?

Notes:

if you ask me how to get to my house,

I can answer two ways

---

Layout: directions-to-my-house
Trail: 2. JSX, Declarative

**Q:** How do you get to my house?

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/directions-imperative.jpg" data-background-size="70%" data-background-color="#ffffff" -->

Notes:

I can tell you to

- walk out the door
- get in your car
- drive it onto i-670 headed east
- turn onto 70 north
- 29
  ...

And that's an _imperative_ answer. It tells you very specifically _how_ to get to my house.

**Q:** How do you get to my house?

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/directions-declarative.jpg" data-background-size="70%" data-background-color="#ffffff" -->

Notes:

Or I can tell you my address

And I can leave it up to you to figure out the "how"

this is _declarative_

it tells you WHAT my address is, and leaves the HOW to you.

---

Trail: 2. JSX, Declarative

```
var artistsComingToMyParty = [];
for (var i = 0; i < artists.length; i++) {
  var artist = artists[i];
  if (artist.rsvp === true) {
    artistsComingToMyParty.push(artist);
  }
}
```

```
var artistsComingToMyParty = artists.filter(
  artist => artist.rsvp === true);
```

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

or in code, the difference is illustrated here

top: Imperative

bottom: declarative

---

Trail: 2. JSX, Declarative

## Imperative code is **abstracted** so that we can call it **declaratively**

Notes:

It's important to note, the imperative code doesn't just evaporate

Often we have to abstract it before other code can call it declaratively

---

Trail: 2. JSX, Declarative

> Declarative views make your code **more predictable** and **easier to debug**.

[reactjs.org](reactjs.org)

Notes:

The big advantage to this declarative style of code is...

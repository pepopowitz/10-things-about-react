Notes:

My kids when they were in kindergarten got to make a huge poster when they were the "star student"

Where they put everything you need to know about them

So I did the same

- JS
- Super cool letter S
- Family
- Outdoors/trail running

Notes:

And now I'm building apps with React, and have been for the last few years, and I'm really happy.

- easy to write code
- easy to write app

## Notes: React is based on components

---

Trail: 1. Components

> Build **encapsulated components** that manage their own state, then **compose them** to make complex UIs.

[reactjs.org](reactjs.org)

Notes:

straight from docs

This is _different_ from when we were doing MVC/MVVM

And the other major players right now are doing the same thing

---

Trail: 1. Components

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/artsy-components-1.jpg" data-background-size="75%" data-background-color="#ffffff" -->

Notes:

Whereas we used to think of an app like this in terms of one page and/or one controller

---

Trail: 1. Components

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/artsy-components-2.jpg" data-background-size="75%" data-background-color="#ffffff" -->

Notes:

Now we think in terms of this page being composed of many components

https://your-first-react-app.stevenhicks.me/#p70

---

Trail: 1. Components

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/artsy-components-3.jpg" data-background-size="75%" data-background-color="#ffffff" -->

Notes:

And those components are composed of _other_ components

...

This is actually an activity I do when I'm developing a new feature:

Draw out the component boundaries before I start coding it.

...

But if we do a good job of identifying our component boundaries,

---

Trail: 1. Components

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/lego-artsy-bin.jpg" data-background-size="100%" -->

Notes:

It's almost like we have a bunch of legos ready to assemble

---

Trail: 1. Components

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/lego-artsy-artwork.jpg" data-background-size="100%" -->

Notes:

And we can build bigger blocks with those legos,

---

Trail: 1. Components

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/lego-artsy-artworks.jpg" data-background-size="100%" -->

Notes:

And then we can take a bunch of those slightly larger blocks

---

Trail: 1. Components

Layout: inverse

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/lego-artsy-level-2.jpg" data-background-size="100%" -->

Notes:

And we can build an entire app with them

---

Trail: 1. Components

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/building-blocks.jpg" -->

Notes:

https://your-first-react-app.stevenhicks.me/#p82

In order to do this well, we really need to focus on isolation of our components.

(left image: not properly isolated, one component that does several things)

(right image: properly isolated; components are building blocks.)

---

Trail: 1. Components

## **Isolation of components** leads to reusability

Notes:

_Not_ the other way around. So focus on proper isolation.

---

Trail: 1. Components

## The most important contribution from React is **thinking in terms of components**

Notes:

Components aren't unique to react,

but React popularized this approach

and it is IMO the single biggest contribution from React.

---

Trail: 1. Components

> Conceptually, components are like **JavaScript functions**. They accept arbitrary **inputs**... and return React elements describing **what should appear on the screen**.

[reactjs.org](reactjs.org)

---

Trail: 1. Components, Are Functions

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/component-f-props.jpg" data-background-size="75%" data-background-color="#ffffff" -->

Notes:

- they take inputs (props)

- they render to the screen

---

Trail: 1. Components, Are Functions

> [a component function...] **should be pure**, meaning that it does not modify component state, it returns the same result each time it’s invoked, and it does not directly interact with the browser.

[reactjs.org](reactjs.org)

Notes:

- they should be pure

- what's a pure function?

---

Trail: 1. Components, Are Functions, And Are Pure

## A pure function:

- ### is deterministic

- ### does not have side-effects

---

Trail: 1. Components, Are Functions, And Are Pure

## Pure 👍🏽

```
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Notes:

examples

---

Trail: 1. Components, Are Functions, And Are Pure

## Impure 👎

```
function now() {
  return new Date();
}
```

Notes:

doesn't return the same result each time it's called

---

Trail: 1. Components, Are Functions, And Are Pure

## Impure 👎🏽

```
function decrement() {
  this.x = this.x - 1;
}
```

Notes:

It modifies state

---

Trail: 1. Components, Are Functions

```
import React from 'react';

function Artist(props) {
  console.log(props.name, props.url);
}
```

Notes:

Here's what a function component looks like.

This is a component that isn't actually _rendering_, it's just logging

But you can see it's got two inputs being passed in via props - a name and a url.

...

if this is what inputs look like; how does it render to the browser?

---

Trail: 1. Components, Are Functions, createElement

```
function Artist(props) {
  return React.createElement('div');
}
```

```
<div />
```

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

using a helper from React named createElement

Give it the element type

...

rendered to browser as a div

---

Trail: 1. Components, Are Functions, createElement

```
function Artist(props) {
  return React.createElement(
    'div',
    { id: 'artist-wrapper' },
    'Hi!'
  );
}
```

```
<div id="artist-wrapper">Hi!</div>
```

Notes:

2nd arg - attributes to apply to element

3rd arg - child elements!

---

Trail: 1. Components, Are Functions, createElement

```
function Artist(props) {
  return React.createElement(
    'div',
    { id: 'artist-wrapper' },
    props.name
  );
}
```

```
<div id="artist-wrapper">Andy Warhol</div>
```

Notes:

We can use a prop as a child text element!

When the prop changes, React will re-render

---

Trail: 1. Components, Are Functions, createElement

```javascript
function Artist(props) {
  return React.createElement(
    'div',
    null,
    React.createElement('h1', null, 'Artworks by ' + props.name)
  );
}
```

```
<div>
  <h1>Artworks by Andy Warhol</h1>
</div>
```

Notes:

We've looked at some simple examples, but usually our components are more complex

We might want to render markup like this:

---

Trail: 1. Components, Are Functions, createElement

```
<div id="artist">
  <div id="bio">
    <h1>Andy Warhol</h1>
    <h2>American, 1928 - 1987</h2>
  </div>
  <div id="photo">
    <a href="/artists/andy-warhol">
      <img src="/artists/andy-warhol/image" alt="Andy Warhol" />
    </a>
  </div>
</div>
```

Notes:

And in that case, the createElement statements would look like this:

---

Trail: 1. Components, Are Functions, createElement

```
function Artist(props) {
  return React.createElement(
    'div',
    { id: 'artist' },
    React.createElement(
      'div',
      { id: 'bio' },
      React.createElement('h1', null, props.name),
      React.createElement('h2', null, props.origin + ', ' + props.lifespan)
    ),
    React.createElement(
      'div',
      { id: 'photo' },
      React.createElement(
        'a',
        {
          href: '/artists/' + props.id,
        },
        React.createElement('img', {
          src: props.profileImageUrl,
          alt: props.name,
        })
      )
    )
  )
}
```

Notes:

As you can see, that's just not sustainable.

So while you'll build your UI with a series of React.createElement calls,

there's another abstraction you'll want to use that will make your life easier.

And that brings us to....

Trail: 2. JSX

> JSX is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript without any defined semantics.

[facebook.github.io/jsx/](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/)

Notes:

It's XML in Javascript

---

Trail: 2. JSX

```
function Artist() {
  return React.createElement('div');
}
```

```
function Artist() {
  return <div />;
}
```

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

Here's our first example from before - React.createElement to render a div.

...

Here's what it looks like as JSX

(PAUSE)

note - no quotes around angle brackets

---

Trail: 2. JSX

```
function Artist(props) {
  return React.createElement(
    'div',
    { id: 'artist-wrapper' },
    props.name
  );
}
```

```
function Artist(props) {
  return (
    <div id="artist-wrapper">
      {props.name}
    </div>
  )
}
```

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

- example that renders a name

(PAUSE)

- you might think you'll hate it
  - combo of xml & javascript, yikes!
  - but react.createElement is verbose & gross

---

Trail: 2. JSX

```
function Artist(props) {
  return React.createElement(
    'div',
    { id: 'artist' },
    React.createElement(
      'div',
      { id: 'bio' },
      React.createElement('h1', null, props.name),
      React.createElement('h2', null, props.origin + ', ' + props.lifespan)
    ),
    React.createElement(
      'div',
      { id: 'photo' },
      React.createElement(
        'a',
        {
          href: '/artists/' + props.id,
        },
        React.createElement('img', {
          src: props.profileImageUrl,
          alt: props.name,
        })
      )
    )
  )
}
```

Notes:

remember this more complicated component?

With JSX, it looks like this:

---

Trail: 2. JSX

```
function Artist(props) {
  return (
    <div id="artist">
      <div id="bio">
        <h1>{props.name}</h1>
        <h2>{props.origin}, {props.lifespan}</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="photo">
        <a href={'/artists/' + props.id}>
          <img src={props.profileImageUrl} alt={props.name} />
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Notes:

(PAUSE)

It looks like the markup we want it to emit!

---

Trail: 2. JSX

## Separation Of Concerns

Notes:

Often when people see JSX, they start talking about "separation of concerns"

---

Trail: 2. JSX, Separation Of Concerns

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/slicing-horizontal.jpg" data-background-size="75%" data-background-color="#ffffff" -->

Notes:

And our instinct as engineers, historically, is to separate our code into layers

keep your HTML with your HTML, JS with JS, ...

---

Trail: 2. JSX, Separation Of Concerns

> Instead of artificially **separating technologies** by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both.

[reactjs.org](reactjs.org)

Notes:

React addresses this claim head-on

Stating that this traditional separation is a separation of _technologies_, not concerns

(read it)

---

Trail: 2. JSX, Separation Of Concerns

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/slicing-vertical.jpg" data-background-size="75%" data-background-color="#ffffff" -->

Notes:

When you're thinking in components, you can scrap the technological layers

The concern is each individual component

(PAUSE)

---

Trail: 2. JSX

```
function Artist(props) {
  if (props.name === 'Andy Warhol') {
    return <div>I like your soup cans!</div>;
  }
  return <div>You make nice art.</div>;
}
```

Notes:

Because JSX is a superset of JavaScript,

we can write our components entirely in JS

No templating languages necessary.

Here's a component that's using an if to decide which div to render.

We get to use latest ES features anywhere in our code.

---

Trail: 2. JSX

## Components in JSX lead to **declarative** code

Notes:

Let's talk a bit about why that matters,

and we'll start with what it means for code to be declarative.

---

Trail: 2. JSX, Declarative

**Q:** How do you get to my house?

Notes:

if you ask me how to get to my house,

I can answer two ways

---

Layout: directions-to-my-house
Trail: 2. JSX, Declarative

**Q:** How do you get to my house?

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/directions-imperative.jpg" data-background-size="70%" data-background-color="#ffffff" -->

Notes:

I can tell you to

- walk out the door
- get in your car
- drive it onto i-670 headed east
- turn onto 70 north
- 29
  ...

And that's an _imperative_ answer. It tells you very specifically _how_ to get to my house.

---

Layout: directions-to-my-house
Trail: 2. JSX, Declarative

**Q:** How do you get to my house?

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/directions-declarative.jpg" data-background-size="70%" data-background-color="#ffffff" -->

Notes:

Or I can tell you my address

And I can leave it up to you to figure out the "how"

this is _declarative_

it tells you WHAT my address is, and leaves the HOW to you.

---

Trail: 2. JSX, Declarative

```
var artistsComingToMyParty = [];
for (var i = 0; i < artists.length; i++) {
  var artist = artists[i];
  if (artist.rsvp === true) {
    artistsComingToMyParty.push(artist);
  }
}

Trail: 2. JSX, Declarative

## Imperative code is **abstracted** so that we can call it **declaratively**

Notes:

It's important to note, the imperative code doesn't just evaporate

Often we have to abstract it before other code can call it declaratively

- No massive stylesheet to style your entire app

- Remember that not much is built into React, so you have **So many options**!

function Artist(props) {
  return <div className="artist">{props.name}</div>
}

Notes:

But you don't have to get super complicated.

You can just stick CSS stylesheets alongside each component, and import them

(Or SCSS if you prefer that)

---

Trail: 4. State Management

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/component-f-props-state.jpg" data-background-size="75%" data-background-color="#ffffff" -->

Notes:

Components are _actually_ functions of both their props and their state

...

props are passed into a component

state is contained within a component

and the component manages it.

Examples:

- the checked state of a checkbox.
- the current value of a counter

...

- when you update props OR state of a component, React re-renders it

---

Trail: 4. State Management

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/state-turns-into-props.jpg" data-background-size="75%" data-background-color="#ffffff" -->

Notes:

Once you have a component managing its state,

it can pass it down to its children as props

This is a really common thing to do in React-

elevate the state to the highest level that any other component would need it, and manage it there.

...

When it comes to ways to manage state, you've got options!

---

Trail: 4. State Management, Options

## `useState`

```javascript
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Notes:

- every time that button gets clicked, state gets updated, & component re-rendered
- If you need to manage more than one property, you just add more `useState`

Great for

- managing individual component state
- closely related components

...

and then a whole bunch of other great options:

---

Trail: 4. State Management, Options

## `useReducer`

## `useContext`

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## `Redux`

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## `MobX`

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## `mobx-state-tree`

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

Many options for dealing with application-level state

- useReducer: more complicated state that depends on the previous state
- useContext: for managing state across a large sub-tree
- redux - application state that provides middleware in your state mgmt
- mobx - application-level state mgmt w/ observables
- mobx-state-tree - more opinionated version of MobX

- caution: don't use these unless you know you need them

---

Trail: 5. New Features

## Hooks

> Hooks are functions you can use in a Component to perform impure actions from a pure function.

Notes:

Remember we said our components are pure functions,

and pure functions shouldn't have side-effects, or change state

Hooks allow us to do that safely,

and in a way that allows React to re-render components when it needs to

---

Trail: 5. New Features, Hooks

## `useState`

## `useReducer`

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## `useContext`

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

- useState: For managing component state

- useReducer: For managing more complicated state

- useContext: For managing state across large subtrees

...

You might notice a pattern - all start with "use"

---

Trail: 5. New Features, Hooks

## `useEffect`

```jsx
function ArtistDetails(props) {
  const [artist, setArtist] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const apiArtist = loadArtistFromApi(props.artistId)
    setArtist(apiArtist)
  }, [])

  return ( ... )
}
```

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

Trail: 5. New Features, Hooks

## `useEffect`

```jsx
function Chat(props) {
  useEffect(() => {

    socket.emit('join', { id: props.friendId });

    return () => {
      socket.emit('leave', { id: props.friendId });
    }

  }, [ props.friendId ])

  return ( ... )
}
```

Notes:

For performing side-effects from a component

- What to do to fire the effect
- what to do to clean up the effect
- when the effect should re-run

...

Notice: the "leaving" of a socket is going to happen in the future sometime

but we're still able to reference the friendId prop from when it rendered

---

Trail: 5. New Features, Hooks

## Closures

> A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.

[developer.mozilla.org](developer.mozilla.org)

Notes:

That's because JavaScript forms closures over variables when you declare a function

This is really helpful for the `useEffect` hook especially, and its multiple callback functions:

---

Trail: 5. New Features, Hooks

## `useEffect`

```jsx
function Chat(props) {
  useEffect(() => {

    socket.emit('join', { id: props.friendId });

    return () => {
      socket.emit('leave', { id: props.friendId });
    }

  }, [ props.friendId ])

  return ( ... )
}
```

Notes:

you know when your cleanup function executes, it's going to disconnect from the right friend's socket

...

But that's the happy path to closures in JavaScript.

They can be really difficult to understand and manage, even in React hooks,

---

---

Trail: 5. New Features

## Suspense

> Suspense lets components “wait” for something before rendering.

[reactjs.org](reactjs.org)

Notes:

This is a really neat way to solve the problem that it takes time for browsers to load things.

Until Suspense, we've had to manage "isLoading" flags all over our app

---

Trail: 5. New Features, Suspense

```jsx
const ArtistGraphs = React.lazy(() => import('./ArtistGraphs'));

function Artist() {
  return (
    <React.Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
      <ArtistGraphs />
    </React.Suspense>
  );
}
```

Notes:

now, we can use React Suspense to emit fallback content,

like a loading indicator,

until something finishes loading.

...

That currently includes the ability to load the code for a component separate from the main application, lazily, when the user actually needs it,

Soon, it will include the ability to emit fallback content

until **data fetching** is complete for a component

---

Trail: 5. New Features

## Backwards compatible

Notes:

- released as "Minor" version

- Backwards compatible - you can do things the old way, too

- This shows the care & consideration the React team takes to let you build your app the way YOU want to

Notes:

- integrates easily with babel

- converts modern javascript syntax into javascript that is understood by all the browsers your app needs to support.

- this means we can use the latest javascript specs in our app!

...

destructuring; fat arrow function w/ implicit return; object spread

React will leave you a _lot_ of freedom in your implementation

But that can be a thing that is really overwhelming.

- no configuration needed

- finds your tests if they're there

---

## Interactive watch mode

Notes:

- by default runs only the tests affected by your uncommitted local changes

- great for TDD

- running only a few tests that you're actively interested in

---

## Great error messages

<img data-src="/images/jest-error.jpg" width="70%"/>

```javascript
describe('findSimilarArtists', () => {
  it('finds similar artists for Andy Warhol', () => {
    const result = findSimilarArtists('Andy Warhol');

    expect(result[0]).toEqual('Robert Indiana');
  });
});
```

Notes:

syntax

- describe
- it
- act
- assert
  - assertions are called "matchers"

---

Trail: 7. Testing, Jest

```javascript
expect(a).toEqual(b);

expect(a).not.toEqual(b);

expect(a).toBeGreaterThan(b);

expect(a).toBeNull();

expect(a).toBeUndefined();
```

Notes:

Over 30 different matchers out of the box

You can write custom ones

---

Trail: 7. Testing

## react-testing-library

Notes:

And then for specifically testing React,

there's a great library called r-t-l

You can use it with Jest

---

Trail: 7. Testing, react-testing-library

```javascript
describe('ArtistDetail', () => {
  it('renders something', () => {

    const context = render(
      <ArtistDetail artist={...} />
    );

    const button = context.queryByText('Details');
    fireEvent.click(button);

    expect(context.getByTestId('artist-details'))
      .toHaveTextContent('Andy Warhol')

  });
});
```

Notes:

Great API for

- rendering
- interacting with elements
- asserting presence of elements

...

There are other libraries for testing React, too - Enzyme is a popular one

But this is the boss hog of testing in react.

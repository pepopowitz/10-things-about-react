# 10 Things You'll Love About React

## Abstract

This session is intended for developers searching for a front-end JavaScript framework they can fall in love with.

We’ll look at ten ways that React will delight you as a developer. Among them:

- React apps are built with components. This is more than an architectural detail. It helps you identify and define the seams of your app, which improves maintainability.
- React uses one-directional flow of data, instead of two-way data-binding. This seems limiting at first, but it leads to code that is more predictable and simpler to understand.
- React testing is more intuitive than testing in any other JavaScript framework. The tooling for React testing is fantastic, and the tests are easy to write and read.
- JSX - a strange-looking combination of JavaScript and HTML. It will shift your understanding of the “separation of concerns”.

We’ll also cover a few things you might not love. Styling, state management, and decision fatigue are all controversial topics in React. They can be intimidating to developers who are new to React.

But the pros outweigh the cons, and even things you initially dislike will grow on you. React is a fantastic developer experience.

You’ll leave this session inspired to build an app with React, and ready to migrate your existing apps.
